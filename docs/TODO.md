# TODO.md - Azqato's Prompts

Ideas and future updates for this project. Add one bullet per idea, in plain
language, with any links or files it refers to. Claude does not build these
directly: when it next pushes an update (or finishes a major update, where the
project is not pushed anywhere), it asks whether to turn them into Roadmap
updates in docs/PRD.md. It researches each idea, works out what you mean, and
writes the update in its own words. Once an idea is in the Roadmap, it is
removed from this file. Never put passwords, keys, or other secrets here.

## Ideas

- Add to site: Legal Audit prompt
  - Your vibe-coded app can get sued for $100K before it makes a single sale. 6 traps hiding in most AI-built apps: Signup never asks for age + COPPA: up to $53K per child under 13 Google Fonts loaded from Google’s servers → a Munich court made a site pay €100 to ONE visitor for leaking their IP (GDPR) Session replay on by default → recording keystrokes can count as wiretapping in California (CIPA): $5K per session “We launched” email with no unsubscribe link or postal address → CAN-SPAM: up to $53K per email Subscription checkout without renewal terms next to the button → in California, renewals can count as a gift you have to refund No registered DMCA agent (it costs $6) → you lose safe harbor for user uploads: up to $150K per stolen image The word is PER. Per visitor. Per session. Per email. That’s how zero sales turns into a hundred grand. The fix: paste this into Claude 👇 “Audit my app for these 6 legal risks and fix them: add an age gate to signup, self-host my fonts, turn off session replay (or add consent + input masking), add an unsubscribe link and postal address to every marketing email, show renewal terms right next to the subscribe button and walk me through registering a DMCA agent.”
